## Which repository setup will we use?
We will be using a mono repository, as we find it the simplest and easiest to use.

## Which branching model will we use?
We will be using a variant of the Github Flow. This involves creating an issue for every feature/fix/change needed to be done. The creating a branch from 'development' 
with a name along the lines of feature/issue-num/descriptive-name. Then closing the issue when the branch is merged back into 'development'.

## Which distributed development workflow will we use?
We will be using the centralized workflow, due to the fact that we are 4 developers on the team, with the same responsibilities for the repository.

## How do we expect contributions to look like?
We will be using the 'Private Small Team' collaboration model in this project.

## Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
This should be as evenly distributed as possible. It will be most necessary when bigger features are involved, as opposed to smaller fixes which can be done in pairs,
thereby reviewing the code as its being made.
